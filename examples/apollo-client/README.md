## Envelop example with [`Apollo client`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client).

Useful for server-side rendering that avoids network calls, if you're rendering on the same server
that the GraphQL API runs on.

## Running this example

1. Install all dependencies from the root of the repo (using `pnpm i`)
2. `cd` into the example and run `pnpm start`.
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, look for logs in the console.
