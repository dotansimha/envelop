## Envelop example with Socket.io

This example demonstrates how to implement the GraphQL flow with Envelop and the
[`@n1ru4l/socket-io-graphql-server`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) library, that enhances
an existing Socket.io server with GraphQL capabilities.

## Running this example

1. Install all dependencies from the root of the repo (using `pnpm`)
1. `cd` into this folder and run `pnpm run start`
1. run `pnpm run test:client` for executing a test operation against the server
