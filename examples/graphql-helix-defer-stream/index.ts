  ## Welcome to the envelop graphql-helix demo.
  ##
  ## We prepared some operations for you to try out :)
  ##

  # Basic query, nothing fancy here :)
  query BasicQuery {
    hello
  }

  # Query using stream
  #
  # stream can be used on fields that return lists.
  # The resolver on the backend uses an async generator function for yielding the values.
  # In this demo there is a sleep of one second before the next value is yielded.
  #
  # stream is useful in scenarios where a lot of items must be sent to the client, but you want to show something as soon as possible
  # e.g. a social media feed.
  #
  # The initialCount argument specifies the amount of items sent within the initial chunk.
  query StreamQuery {
    greetings @stream(initialCount: 1)
  }

  # Query using defer
  #
  # defer can be used on fragments in order to defer sending the result to the client, if it takes longer than the rest of the resolvers to yield an value.
  # The User.bio resolver on the backend uses a sleep of 2 seconds for deferring the resolution of the value.
  # Stream is useful when a certain resolver on your backend is slow, but not mandatory for showing something meaningful to your users.
  # An example for this would be a slow database call or third-party service.
  query DeferQuery {
    me {
      id
      name
      ... on User @defer {
        bio
      }
    }
  }

  # Query using both stream and defer
  #
  # Both directives can be used on the same operation!
  query MixedStreamAndDefer {
    me {
      id
      name
      ... on User @defer {
        bio
      }
      friends @stream(initialCount: 1) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }

  # Basic Subscription
  #
  # A subscription is a persistent connection between the graphql client and server and can be used for pushing events to the client.
  #
  # This subscription publishes the current date string every second.
  # Subscriptions are similar to defer and stream implemented via async generators.
  # Any event source such as Redis PubSub or MQTT  can be wrapped in an async generator and used for backing the subscription.
  # The published event value is then passed on to the execution algorithm similar to mutations and subscriptions.
  subscription BasicSubscription {
    clock
