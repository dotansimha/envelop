Plugins are the hearth of Envelop. Without adding any plugins, the GraphQL execution layer provided by Envelop does not differ from the core GraphQL execution layer as provided by GraphQL.js.

## How do Envelop plugins work?

Envelop plugins are based on a simple event-based contract that allows extending and overwriting the GraphQL execution logic, by wrapping the functions `parse`, `validate`, `execute` and `subscribe` from GraphQL.js.

Generic logic can be shared as a plugin, that can be distributed via npm.

## What can plugins can do?

Plugins are capable of modifying and altering every aspect of the GraphQL execution flow, allowing to hook into the phases before and after `parse`, `validate`, `execute`, `subscribe`, as well as building your GraphQL context.

Plugins can also change the GraphQL schema during execution - so if your server has a schema that could change dynamically, you can constantly update it. Plugins can listen to schema changes and run logic accordingly.

## What plugins are available?

You can find a list of all plugins, their documentation and installation instructions on the [Envelop Plugin Hub](/plugins).
