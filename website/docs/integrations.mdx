## Integrations and Examples

Envelop provides a low-level API for integrating it with your server of choice, but a rich API for plugins. Because of the low-level API, it's possible to integrate Envelop with almost any http server or framework.

Our personal recommendation for the request pipeline orchestrator is [`graphql-helix`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix), as it allows maximum flexibility and a seamless integration with envelop.

### Compatibility Table

Here's a list of integrations and examples. This list here includes integrations with different GraphQL servers, different HTTP servers and different GraphQL schema builders.

> Since Envelop is not a HTTP server, and just a wrapper around the GraphQL request pipeline - it's possible to integrate it with any server/framework, if it's flexible enough and allows you to specify the pipeline methods.
