title: Integrations and Examples
---

Envelop provides a low-level API for integrating it with your server of choice, but a rich API for building plugins. It is possible to integrate Envelop with any HTTP server framework and almost any GraphQL Server Framework.

> Our personal recommendation for the request pipeline orchestration is [`graphql-helix`](https://graphql-helix.com/) together with [`fastify`](https://www.fastify.io/), as this combination allows maximum flexibility and a seamless integration with envelop, in addition you can leverage also the fastify plugin eco-system.

## Compatibility Table

Here's a list of integrations and examples. This list here includes integrations with different GraphQL servers, different HTTP servers and different GraphQL schema builders. In case you are missing you favorite server, feel free to add it!

> Since Envelop is not a HTTP server, and just a wrapper around the GraphQL request pipeline - it's possible to integrate it with almost any server/framework.Ã¥
