title: First Steps

Using Envelop is straight-forward and intuitive, in this section you will lean how to install and set up an GraphQL server using Envelop from scratch.

> In case you are being referred to the Envelop documentation from a framework or library that implements envelop, you can straight dive into the [Plugin Hub](/plugins) or head over to the [Plugin Tutorial](/docs/plugins) for learning how to write your own plugins.

## Installation

Start by adding the core of `envelop` and `graphql` to your codebase.

<PackageInstall packages="graphql @envelop/core" />

## Create your first envelop

After installing the `@envelop/core` package, you can use the `envelop` function for creating your `getEnveloped` function. We use a simple GraphQL schema that we build with the `buildSchema` function from `graphql`.

```ts
import { parse, validate, execute, subcribe } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useSchema } from '@envelop/core'
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql'

const schema = buildSchema(/* GraphQL */ `
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`)

export const getEnveloped = envelop({
  parse,
  validate,
  execute,
  subcribe,
  plugins: [useSchema(schema)]
})
```

## Use your envelop

The result of `envelop` is a factory function that allows you to get everything you need for the GraphQL execution: `parse`, `validate`, `contextBuilder`, `execute`, `subscribe` and `perform`. It is usually named `getEnveloped`.

By calling the `getEnveloped` function you will get all the primitive functions required for the GraphQL execution layer.

It's recommended to use the `perform` function which does parsing, validation, context assembly and execution/subscription, and returns a ready result. This function will NEVER throw GraphQL errors, it will instead place them in the result.

```ts
// prettier-ignore
const {
  contextFactory,
  parse,
  validate,
  execute,
  subscribe,
  schema,
  perform,
} = getEnveloped()
```

## Add plugins to your envelop

After you set up your base envelop, you can start customizing your GraphQL server. Adding new functionality is as easy as adding a new envelop plugin to your base envelop setup.

Let's add a parser and validation cache, so sending the same operation string sent to our server is cached using a LRU cache, allowing to improve the overall performance of the GraphQL execution layer.

<PackageInstall packages="@envelop/parser-cache @envelop/validation-cache" />

```ts
import { parse, validate, execute, subcribe } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useSchema } from '@envelop/core'
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql'
import { useParserCache } from '@envelop/parser-cache'
import { useValidationCache } from '@envelop/validation-cache'

const schema = buildSchema(/* GraphQL */ `
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`)

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  parse,
  validate,
  execute,
  subcribe,
  plugins: [
    // all enabled plugins
    useSchema(schema),
    useParserCache(),
    useValidationCache()
  ]
})
```

> A list of all available plugins can be found on the [Envelop Plugin Hub](/plugins).

## Use your envelop with an HTTP server

you can build a very simple GraphQL HTTP server from scratch, by using the Node.js `http` module and only these functions.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql'
import { getEnveloped } from './envelop'

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // body parsing
    req.body = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let data = ''
      req.on('data', chunk => {
        data += String(chunk)
      })
      req.on('end', () => {
        resolve(data)
      })
      req.on('error', err => reject(err))
    })

    const {
      // Get the perform function that does parsing, validation, context assembly and execution/subscription, and returns a ready GraphQL operation result.
      perform
      // pass in an initial context that all plugins can consume and extend
    } = getEnveloped({ req })

    // Parse request body JSON
    const { query, variables } = JSON.parse(req.body)

    // Perform the GraphQL operation. This function will NEVER throw GraphQL errors, it will instead place them in the result.
    const result = await perform({ query, variables })

    // Send the response
    res.end(JSON.stringify(result))
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof GraphQLError === false) {
      err = new GraphQLError(err.message)
    }
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ errors: [err] }))
  }
})

httpServer.listen(3000)
```

After starting this server we can send a GraphQL operation using `curl`, yielding a response of `{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}`.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"query":"{__typename}"}' \
  http://localhost:3000
```

> This example uses the Node.js `http` module and is a very simplified handler that does not strictly follow the [GraphQL over HTTP specification](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) as it does not handle headers or respect HTTP methods. For actual production usage we recommend using Envelop with one of the popular and battle-tested HTTP frameworks and servers. Check the examples on our [Integrations page](/docs/integrations).
