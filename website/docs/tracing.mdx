title: Tracing
---

`envelop` comes with a self-measuring tracing tool, for providing you some insights on the performance of each stage.

If you wish to enable it, pass `enableInternalTracing: true` to your envelop instance:

```ts
const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ],
  enableInternalTracing: true
})
```

This way, on each executed request, you'll get the following object with metrics (measured in `ms`) added to your `result.extensions`:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "_envelopTracing": {
      "parse": 0.1,
      "validate": 0.1,
      "context": 0.1,
      "execute": 0.1,
      "subscribe": 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

> The measured time represents the entire execution, of all plugins, in each phase, including before/after of all plugins, and the actual GraphQL function.
