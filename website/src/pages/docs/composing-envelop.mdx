# Sharing Envelops

## Sharing / Composing `envelop` Instances

After an `envelop` has been created, you can re-use the envelop and compose it with different envelops or plugins. This is useful if you wish to create a predefined layer of plugins and share it with others.
This allows writing shareable pieces that can be used.

Here's a small example for sharing envelops:

```ts
import * as GraphQLJS from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useEnvelop, useSchema, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'

// Somewhere where you wish to create the basics of what you wish to share
// This defined the base plugins you wish to use as a base.
const myBaseEnvelop = envelop({
  plugins: [useOrgAuth(), useOrgTracing(), useOrgLogsCollector()]
})

// Later, when you create your own Envelop, you can extend that and add custom plugins.
// You can also specify the schema only at this point
const myEnvelop = envelop({
  plugins: [useEngine(GraphQLJS), useEnvelop(myBaseEnvelop), useSchema(myServerSchema), useMyCustomPlugin()]
})
```

This approach allows developers to create a base Envelop and share it across the organization: you can define your monitoring setup, logging, authentication, etc., only once in a shared package and share it with others without losing the ability to extend it.
