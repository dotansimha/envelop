# @envelop/inngest

`useInngest` is an [Envelop](https://envelop.dev/) plugin for [GraphQL Yoga](https://envelop.dev/) and servers or frameworks powered by Yoga, such as [RedwoodJS](https://www.redwoodjs.com).

It's philosophy is to:

- "instrument everything" by sending events for each GraphQL execution result to [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com) to effortlessly build event-driven applications.
- provide fine-grained control over what events are sent such as operations (queries, mutations, or subscriptions), introspection events, when GraphQL errors occur, if result data should be included, type and schema coordinate denylists ... and more.
- be customized with event prefix, name and user context functions

# Getting Started

```terminal
yarn add @envelop/inngest
```

## About Inngest

Inngest makes it simple for you to write delayed or background jobs by triggering functions from events â€” decoupling your code from your application.

- You send events from your application via HTTP (or via third party webhooks, e.g. Stripe)
- Inngest runs your serverless functions that are configured to be triggered by those events, either immediately, or delayed.

Inngest brings the benefits of event-driven systems to all developers, without having to write any code themselves.

Inngest believes that:

- Event-driven systems should be easy to build and adopt
- Event-driven systems are better than regular, procedural systems and queues
- Developer experience matters
- Serverless scheduling enables scalable, reliable systems that are both cheaper and better for compliance

## About Yoga and Envelop

[GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) is a batteries-included cross-platform GraphQL over HTTP spec-compliant GraphQL server powered by[Envelop](https://envelop.dev/) and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com/).

Yoga uses Envelop under the hood so you can easily extend your server's capabilities with the plugins from Envelop Ecosystem.

[`Envelop`](https://envelop.dev/) is a lightweight JavaScript (/TypeScript) library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.

Envelop aims to extend the GraphQL execution flow by adding plugins that enriches the feature set of your application.

Envelop provides a low-level hook-based plugin API for developers. By combining plugins, you can compose your own GraphQL "framework", and get a modified version of GraphQL with the capabilities you need.

Envelop is created and maintained by [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/).

## Usage Example

When configuring `useInngest`, you will need to setup and setup an [Inngest client](https://www.inngest.com/docs/quick-start) with the necessary [event keys](https://www.inngest.com/docs/events/creating-an-event-key).

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient })]
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

### Logging

You may set any [Yoga-compatible logger](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/logging-and-debugging)

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema, createLogger } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })
const logger = createLogger()

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, logging: logger })]
})
```

#### Disable Logging

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema, createLogger } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })
const logger = createLogger()

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, logging: false })]
})
```

#### Set Log Level

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema, createLogger } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })
const logger = createLogger()

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, logging: 'warn' })]
})
```

### Custom Event Payload Functions

You may need to customize the event name prefix or event name from its defaults.

The event name prefix is `graphql` and the event name is constructed based on the operation name (aka the `noun` and type (aka the `verb`).

For example, the event name for a query of:

```
query TestQuery { test }
```

will be `graphql/test-query.query`

#### Build Custom Event Name

In the case where you want to completely override the function to construct the entire event name, you can define a `buildEventNameFunction`:

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, buildEventNameFunction: async () => 'custom-graphql/noun.verb' })]
})
```

#### Build Custom Event Name Prefix

The `buildEventNamePrefixFunction` option lets you pass a function to customize the prefix for the event name

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, buildEventNamePrefixFunction: async () => 'custom-graphql' })]
})
```

### User Context

Inngest can also send user context information with the event to contain the user that perform the action.

The `buildUserContextFunction` option let's you define the user context info sent with teh event, such as the authenticated user.

#### Build Custom User Context Info

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

export const userContext: BuildUserContextFunction = (options: InngestUserContextOptions) => {
  const currentUser = options.params.args.contextValue.currentUser

  if (currentUser) {
    return { id: currentUser.id }
  }
  return {}
}

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, buildUserContextFunction: userContext })]
})
```

### Control What Events Sent

You may not want to send every GraphQL result to Inngest.

For example, you may want choose whether or not to send Subscriptions; or, you may want to send errors; or, you may want to block and events when the result data includes particular types or schema coordinates.

There are options that give you control over the defaults that:

- allows queries, mutations and subscription
- never sends introspections
- never sends errors
- never sends anonymous events

#### Only Send Certain Operations

To send only queries, configure the `sendOperations` option:

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest, SendableOperation } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, sendOperations: [SendableOperation.QUERY] })]
})
```

#### Send Errors

If you want to send the event even when an GraphQL Error occurs, you can set `sendErrors` to true.

Note: that in order for you to include the error information, you will also need to set `includeRawResult` to `true` as well.

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, sendErrors: true })]
})
```

#### Send Introspection Queries

If you want to send an event when an introspection query occurs, you can set `sendIntrospection` to `true`:

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, sendIntrospection: true })]
})
```

#### Send Anonymous Queries

If you want to send an event when an anonymous query occurs, you can set `sendAnonymousOperations` to `true`.

Note: Anonymous query events will be send with an event name like `graphql/anonymous-d32327f2ad0fef67462baf2b8410a2b4b2cc8db57e67bb5b3c95efa595b39f30.query` where an operation id is generated based on the operation, document and variables in the request.

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, sendAnonymousOperations: true })]
})
```

#### Do Not Send Events where Types or Schema Coordinates are in a Denylist

There may a reason to block sending the event if the result data contains information for a certain type (like a `User`) or a particular schema coordinate (`Query.user`)

##### Deny list of Types

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, denylist: { types: ['User'] } })]
})
```

##### Deny list of Schema Coordinates

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, denylist: { schemCoordinates: ['Query.user', 'Query.users'] } })]
})
```

### Result Payload

By default, `useInngest` does not send the entire raw result `{data: {}, errors: []}` in the payload because:

- Inngest has a max event payload of 512K and the information could be too large
- The information needed to process the event in the Inngest handler is sent instead as `types` and `identifiers`.

For example, if the query

```
query FindPost { post { id title } }
```

returns a single `Post`, the event payload will include the types in the result and the identifiers (ie, Post with id of 1) such that you can fetch the current data for the posts and handle as needed:

```ts
{
  name: 'graphql/find-post.query',
  data: {
    variables: {},
    identifiers: [
      {
        id: '1',
        typename: 'Post',
      },
    ],
    types: ['Post'],
    result: {},
    operation: { id: 'find-post', name: 'FindPost', type: 'query' },
  },
  user: {},
}
```

You may send the complete raw result by setting `includeRawResult` to `true`:

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, includeRawResult: true })]
})
```

### Redact Sensitive Information from Result Data

```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

import { useInngest } from '@envelop/inngest'
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'

const inngestClient = new Inngest({ name: 'My App' })

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Message {
        body: String!
      }

      type Query {
        greetings: Message!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => {
          body: 'Hello World!'
        }
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useInngest({ inngestClient, includeRawResult: true, redactRawResultOptions: { paths: ['*.body'] } })]
})
```

Then the `body` will not show `Hello World!` but rather `[REDACTED]`.

For a complete set of `RedactOptions`, please see [fast-redact](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/fast-redact).

### Redact Sensitive Information from Variables

You may also want to prevent certain mutation variables to be sent as part of the event payload to redact sensitive info.

If your mutation updates a `User` email by id, you likely won't want to send their email.

```ts
mutation UpdateMyUser($id: ID!, $email: String!) {
  updateUser(id: $id, email: $email) {
    id
    email
  }
}
```

and the variables are:

```ts
{ id: 99, email: 'user@example.com' }
```

The you may redact their email by setting the

```ts
redactRawResultOptions: { paths: ['*.email'] } }
```

which will redact the email in the `variables` sent:

```ts
{
  name: 'graphql/update-my-user.mutation',
  data: {
    variables: { id: 99, email: '[REDACTED]' },
    identifiers: [{ id: '99', typename: 'User' }],
    types: ['User'],
    result: {},
    operation: { id: 'update-my-user', name: 'UpdateMyEmail', type: 'mutation' },
  },
  user: {},
}
```
