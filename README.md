Envelop is a lightweight library for wrapping GraphQL, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins.

Our goal is to allow developers keep the original GraphQL interface, while adding plugins to enrich the feature set of you application quickly, while sharing ideas, code and plugins with other developers.

Envelop is agnostic to the HTTP server you use. We do not aim to provide a complete server, you can use Envelop with any environment (NodeJS or browser), any type of GraphQL workflow (client / server, client-side execute, or server to server) and any other GraphQL framework.

Envelop is zero-dependency, and will only apply changes to your GraphQL execution based on the plugins you wish to use. It can be integrated with any GraphQL server that follows [the execution phase, as defined in the GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Executing-Requests) and let you provide your own lifecycle methods.
