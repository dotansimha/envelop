## Envelop

`envelop` is a lightweight JavaScript (/TypeScript) library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share
and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.

`envelop` aims to extend the GraphQL execution flow by adding plugins that enrichs the feature set of your application.

`@envelop/core`: [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40envelop%2Fcore.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@envelop/core)

> Envelop is created and maintained by [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/), and used in production by our clients.

### [Envelop Key Concepts]((https://www.envelop.dev/docs#key-concepts))

* Lightweight
* Wraps the entire GraphQL pipeline, based on plugins
* Low-level API for extending the execution layer
* Agnostic to the HTTP layer
* Agnostic to the schema tools
* Plugins-based usage
* No vendor-locking

[You can read more about the key concepts or Envelop here](https://www.envelop.dev/docs#key-concepts)

## [Getting Started](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/getting-started)

Start by adding the core of Envelop to your codebase:

```
yarn add graphql @envelop/core
```

Then, create a simple Envelop based on your GraphQL schema:

```ts
import { envelop, useSchema } from '@envelop/core';

const mySchema = buildSchema( ... ); // GraphQLSchema

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useSchema(mySchema)
  ],
});
```

The result of `envelop` is a function that allows you to get everything you need for the GraphQL execution: `parse`, `validate`, `contextBuilder` and `execute`. Use that to run the client's GraphQL queries. Here's a pseudo-code example of how it should look like:

```ts
const httpServer = createServer();

httpServer.on('request', (req, res) => {
  // Here you get the alternative methods that are bundled with your plugins
  // You can also pass the "req" to make it available for your plugins or GraphQL context.
  const { parse, validate, contextFactory, execute, schema } = getEnveloped({ req });

  // Parse the initial request and validate it
  const { query, variables } = JSON.parse(req.payload);
  const document = parse(query);
  const validationErrors = validate(schema, document);

  if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
    return res.end(JSON.stringify({ errors: validationErrors }));
  }

  // Build the context and execute
  const context = await contextFactory(req);
  const result = await execute({
    document,
    schema,
    variableValues: variables,
    contextValue: context,
  });

  // Send the response
  res.end(JSON.stringify(result));
});

httpServer.listen(3000);
```

Behind the scenes, this simple workflow allows you to use **Envelop plugins** and hook into the entire request handling flow.

Here's a simple example for collecting metrics and log all incoming requests, using the built-in plugins:

```ts
const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [useSchema(schema), useLogger(), useTiming()],
});
```

## Available Plugins

You can explore all plugins in our [Plugins Hub](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins). If you wish your plugin to be listed here and under PluginsHub, feel free to add your plugin information [in this file](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop/edit/main/website/src/lib/plugins.ts#L23) and create a Pull Request!

We provide a few built-in plugins within the `@envelop/core`, and many more plugins as standalone packages.

## Sharing / Composing `envelop`s

After an `envelop` has been created, you can share it with others as a complete layer of plugins. This is useful if you wish to create a predefined layer of plugins, and share it with others. You can use it as a shell and as a base for writing shareable pieces of servers.

You can read more about [Sharing and Composing Envelops here](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/composing-envelop).

## Write your own plugin!

Envelop plugins are just objects with functions, that provide contextual implementation for before/after of each phase, with a flexible API.

Here's a simple example that allows you to print the execution params:

```ts
const myPlugin = {
  onExecute({ args }) {
    console.log('Execution started!', { args });

    return {
      onExecuteDone: ({ result }) => {
        console.log('Execution done!', { result });
      },
    };
  },
};

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    /// ... other plugins ...,
    myPlugin,
  ],
});
```
